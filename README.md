# Simple URL Shortener
---
## Description of the project
This project is a simple URL shortener app. It is composed of a REST API built with Django and the Django REST Framework.
A web interface will soon be added to interact with the REST API, and generate new short URL and probably list all the short URLs generated by the user.
An iOS App (built in Swift) is currently in development. It currently allows the user to generate a short URL, and in the near future will a list of the previously generated short URLs will be available, without link, at first, to a user profile.
## Django Server
Currently the Django Server works with 2 URLs:
- <domain_name>/api/ + json{real_url: <the url of the website>, username: <optional username>}: this post method generates a new short code.
- <domain_name>/<short_code> === <short_url>: redirect the user to the URL linked with the matched short_code
We generate short code by randomizing 6 numbers in base 62 (ascii letters in lowercase + uppercase + numbers). Once a short code is generated, we test if this short code is already in the database. If so, then we generate another short code, if not, then we return that short code and build the association in the database between the short code and the real URL
## iOS App
This iOS app is built in Swift 3 for iOS 10. 
It is using a tab-based template:
- first tab: generates a new short URL
- second tab: list of all short URL generated by this app
Currently, only the first tab has been developed.
